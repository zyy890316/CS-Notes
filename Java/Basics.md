* Array: Simple fixed sized arrays that we create in Java, like below
```
int arr[] = new int[10]   
```
* ArrayList : Dynamic sized arrays in Java that implement List interface
```
ArrayList<Type> arrL = new ArrayList<Type>();
```
* List: The List is a child interface of Collection. It is an ordered collection of objects in which duplicate values can be stored. Since List preserves the insertion order, it allows positional access and insertion of elements. List interface is implemented by the classes of ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector and Stack.
